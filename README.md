# Document Management System Project

In this Github repository you will find all the files needed to run my project : a re-creation of a Document Management System using the ADA programing language.

You will also find two .md files :

- user_manual.md : A quick and simple user guide to help you use the command prompt of the Document Management System
- project_report.md : My report for this project, containing what choices I made to implement this DMS and my experience during the process of doing this project
